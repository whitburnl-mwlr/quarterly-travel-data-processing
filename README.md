# quarterly-travel-data-processing
Tool for processing the quarterly travel data, importing it into MySQL (or MariaDB) and then processing it and then exporting it such that it can be made into a LaTeX report.

Run as `./run.sh`. This is to be used in a Windows environment (i.e. via VirtualBox), so make sure that the input shared folder is mounted at `/mnt/Input`, and the output is at `/mnt/Output`.
